# sbn64
Simple Byteswapper for N64 Saves

This program is designed to convert N64 saves between different formats generated by various emulators, by cutting/padding the source file and/or performing a 32-bit byteswapping operation on it. Usage is pretty much straightforward and it's also explained in the program itself.

As of v1.75, sbn64 is able to convert to/from the formats generated by these emulators:

* Wii64 (big endian).
* Project64 (PC, little endian).
* Wii N64 Virtual Console titles (big endian, different save sizes, different padding value).
* Sixtyforce (Mac, big endian). Also compatible with Controller Pak data (extraction only).
* EverDrive 64 (16-bit byteswapped).

This code is of public domain, so just have at it.
